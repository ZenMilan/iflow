# Benefits

* **Keep the data structure primitive**

iFlow because of the proxy mechanism, it retains the primitive nature of the data structure while supporting asynchronous functions as well as other types of functions, including, of course, ordinary classes and functions.

* **No boilerplate code**

iFlow can give you more freedom to use it to implement a state data structure that is in line with the actual development needs, and not to have too many boilerplate code because of the limitations of various libraries.

* **Be easy to OOP**

Sometimes when we need decoupled business code, we may need some object-oriented programming when design, so the State Library is better if it can support it.

* **As few selectors as possible**

When using a web framework such as react, the corresponding connection library [react-iflow](https://github.com/unadlib/react-iflow) allows you to write and manipulate as few selectors as possible.

* **Powerful middleware**

If necessary, in fact iflow is powerful and useful, and you can use it to implement a variety of coupled business codes.

* **Composable and scalable store**

iFlow advocates the store group to synthesize the store tree without worrying about the performance impact of the unrelated store, because it is dynamically matched and you can be assured of free combination and expansion of the store.
